        I have no idea how to start solving this mission

    <div class="answer">
        You need to split the given text into strings and filter the empty strings (or even if only spaces in the string) and non-empty.

        It will be useful for you to read some information about two string methods:  <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=split#str.split'>str.split()</a> and
         <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strip#str.strip'>str.strip()</a>.

        I have gone halfway through. Need help!
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Look how works str.split() method:
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "Hello, world!"
text.split()  # By default, str.split() return a list of the words in the string,
              # using "sep" as spaces
>> ['Hello,', 'world!']

text.split('o')  # If we enter "sep" as letter "o", we will see next
>> ['Hell', ', w', 'rld!']
        </pre>
        In our case, you need to use "\n" as "sep". This is the new line symbol, it marks where the current line ends and a new line begins.

        I am stuck. I need a small hint.

    <div class="answer">
        Look how works str.strip() method:
        <pre class="brush: python">
txt = "     banana     "
txt.strip()  # We have a lot of spaces at the beginning and at the end of the word
>> "banana"  # Using txt.strip() we remove spaces at the beginning and at the
             # end of the word

        I tried all I could. Nothing works. SOS

    <div class="answer">
        Okay, you need to combine two methods using for-loop and condition "if". In condition "if" we need to check
         if the string is empty or not, using <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/functions.html#len'>len()</a>
        <pre class="brush: python">
text = "Hello, world!"
for i in text.split():  # Use for loop to iterate the splitted text
                        # ("Hello," and "world!")
    if len(i.strip()) > 0:  # Check if the strings are not empty
            print("OK")  # Print "OK" if all good
>> "OK"
>> "OK"
        </pre>
    </div>

        One last question. How my final solution will look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <pre class="brush: python">
def non_empty_lines(text: str) -> int:
    t = 0
    for i in text.split('\n'):
        if len(i.strip()) > 0:
            t += 1
    return t
        </pre>
        Look at the one-line mission solution, this option allows you to reduce your code and make it more lightweight
          from redundant variables of the "t = 0" type.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def non_empty_lines(text: str) -> int:
    return len([x for x in s.split("\n") if x.strip()])
    # Here we are not using a row counter, but a list of non-empty rows.
    # And as a result, we return its length using len()
        </pre>
    </div>
